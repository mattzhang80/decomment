What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the

"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and

should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
I hated this assigment, it was impossible to debug so many cases. Even 
the Lab TAs were stumped on some of my bugs (Though, I am still 
thankful for them). I spent around 12 hours on this assignment which is 
a lot more than I expected. I did not have fun at all, but I did learn
more about systems programming, I guess. I hate to think about how this
will be the "easiest" assignment of the semester. This is seriously 
making me question my aspirations as a COS major or Software Engineer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
Thankfully, I got rid of the bugs, but I've edited this code throughout
so many different sessions that it may not be a cohesive style. However,
I did try to make it as readable as possible. It should pass all cases.
